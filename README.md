pphtml
======

A plugin for the KDE Kate Editor that pretty formats HTML. Based on style_html:

https://github.com/einars/js-beautify/blob/master/beautify-html.js

(although I took the current code from the jsbeautifier site).

##Install

Put the .js file in ~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/script/

##Usage

Type the F7 key or select the menu item View->"Switch to Command Line", then type pphtml on that command line. 
The current document's contents should then be replaced with a pretty printed copy.

You can also bind pphtml to a shortcut key combination. Select "Settings->Configure Shortcuts..." 
and search for "Pretty prints html"
